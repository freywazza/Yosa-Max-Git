*****Yosa Mix Icon Theme*****

## V.1.0.0 (Oct 23 2017)
## The first release of Yosa Mix Icon Theme.

## V.1.0.1 (Dec 31 2017)
## Minor fix to the network manager icon on the panel when using dial-up/broadband connection (changed the icon so it doesn't looked transparent).

## V.1.2 (Jul 08 2018)
## From now on, "Yosa Mix" will continue as "Yosa Max", as I'm trying to make it more "original" by adding more and more new icons :).
## Changed some System Settings icons : preferences-desktop, preferences-desktop-plasma, preferences-desktop-theme, preferences-desktop-icons, preferences-desktop-activities, preferences-desktop-effects, plasma, plasma-media-center; Changed some devices icons : audio-headphones, audio-input-microphones, audio-speakers, computer, computer-laptop; Changed Places : user-desktop; etc.
## More new icons will be coming soon (hopefully) as I'm a bit busy with my work right now, until then keep the love by using this icon theme ;))
