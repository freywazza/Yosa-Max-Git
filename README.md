Yosa Max Icon Theme GitHub Repository (previously known as Yosa Mix Icon Theme)

A free-form, bright, and clear icon theme while maintaining some of its subtlety.

This icon theme is originally based on the popular la capitaine icon theme, with a different kind of style to differentiate it from the original one.

Feel free to contribute to this project. You can add new icons or modify/change/improve the existing icons.
There are no strict guidelines or rules for creating new icons for this icon theme. As long as it looks good and matches with other icons, then that's it.
I'll always be happy to receive any kind of contributions.
